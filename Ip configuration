Effective communication and safe data transmission inside and between departments in Building A and Building B are guaranteed by the IP setup for Omni College's network. VLANs 10, 20, and 30 in Building A are designated for the departments of Administration, Finance, and Academics, respectively, with IP address ranges of 172.168.0.0/24, 172.168.1.0/24, and 172.168.2.0/24 to enhance network security & separate network traffic. Up to 254 useable IP addresses per department are possible with each VLAN's 255.255.255.0 subnet mask. To regulate traffic routing within the local network, each VLAN's default gateway must be configured to the final IP address that can be used. The academic, financial, and administrative departments of Building B are assigned VLANs 40, 60, and 50, respectively. The following IP address ranges are present in these VLANs: 172.18.18.4.0/24, 172.18.18.5.0/24, and 172.18.13.0/24. The default gateway and subnet mask of Building A are echoed, ensuring uniformity and ease of maintenance between the two structures. 
Additionally, routers are utilized to link each building to the Internet. The IP addresses 10. 10. 0. 0/30 for Building A's Router A and 20. 20. 0. 0/30 for Building B's Router B are required for the Internet to function. Gateways for traffic entering and leaving the college's network are provided by these routers, which also help with external communication. With VLAN segmentation offering network traffic separation and IP address assignments enabling effective routing and communication, Omni College is able to establish an organized and secure network environment through the use of this IP setup.
